## This project is meant for @Arguimbau and @Kai0077 's elective exam in Mashine-Learning
The goal for this project is to use YOLOv9 to detect wether or not a licence plate is in a picture, and then use EasyOCR to detect the text within

The weight is too large for GitHub, so I recommend training the dataset yourself to get it

The dataset can be found here:
